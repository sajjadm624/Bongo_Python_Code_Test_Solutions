### Solution No.1
###### Its done with a recursive approach
I am looping through the dictionary and when I found nested dictionery then I do recursive of the same function with depth value with increased 1!

### Solution No.2
###### Its done with the same approach
I just added one new function which was accused for finding the depth of object just checked previous fuction for object when I get any object it has called the new function and with recursive approach I then find the depth.

### Solution No.3
###### Its done with a recusive approach
I have stored two auxiliary path from root to x and root to y and then I traverse through them simultaunously untill the values in the array are matched. The last matching value is the LCA of two nodes.

#### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(n) since i have to traverse all the node.
#### Space Complexity
The space complexity for this solution is O(h) where h is the depth/height of tree.
